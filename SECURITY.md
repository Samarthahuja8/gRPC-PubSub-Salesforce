## Security

Please report any security issue to [security@salesforce.com](mailto:security@salesforce.com)
as soon as it is discovered. These libraries limit their runtime dependencies in
order to reduce the total cost of ownership as much as can be, but all consumers
should remain vigilant and have their security stakeholders review all third-party
products (3PP) like these examples and their dependencies.
